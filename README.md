# Fluentd Aggregator

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

A [Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/) _Docker_ image to be used for log aggregation and based on the official [Fluentd Docker image](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd-docker-image).

## Aggregation Changes

To optimise _Fluentd_ for log aggregation the default `fluent.conf` file has been overwritten to allow logs to be forwarded and printed to stdout. Plugins have also been added to support the aggregation role.

The following plugins have been added to the base image.

- [fluent-plugin-aws-elasticsearch-service](https://github.com/atomita/fluent-plugin-aws-elasticsearch-service)
